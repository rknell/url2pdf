#Url2PDF
---
Grab a URL and convert the HTML to PDF using PhantomJS.
Phantom renders the printing version.
Can be used for generating bills, protocols, lists, etc. from a website.




## Installation ##

    npm install url2pdf --save

## Getting started ##

    node examles.js

Then look into the project folder "pdfTemp"

## API

#### PDF from URL

```javascript
    var url2pdf = require("url2pdf");

    url2pdf.renderPdf("http://www.google.com")
    	.then(function(path){
	    	console.log("Rendered pdf @", path);
    	});
```


#### PDF From HTML String
So you have made your html in Jade etc and now you want to just turn it into a PDF without creating a whole website
just for this purpose? Easy! Just do as below:

```javascript
    var url2pdf = require("url2pdf");
    url2pdf.renderFromHTML("<html><body><h1>HELLO WORLD</h1></body></html>")
    	.then(function(path){
	    	console.log("Rendered pdf @", path);
    	});
```

#### In Express route as a download

```javascript
    var url2pdf = require("url2pdf");

    function myRoute(req, res){
        url2pdf.renderPdf(url)
            .then(function (path) {
                res.sendFile(path);
            })
            .catch(function(err){
                res.status(500).json(err);
            })
    }
```

#### Manual cleanup
url2pdf comes with an auto cleanup function that will delete old files in your temp directory. For a manual cleanup disable the auto cleanup in the function call:

```javascript
    url2pdf.renderFromHTML("htmlString ..." ,{
     autoCleanFileAgeInSec: -1 // set disabled in options
     }).then( ...
```

To clean the tmp folder call the following function, passing in the age in *seconds* you would like to delete:
```javascript
    url2pdf.cleanUp(5); // clean up all files older than 5 seconds
```

## Configuration options
You can set the configuration options globally by editing the `url2pdf.opts` object. The default settings are shown below

```javascript
    {
      paperSize: {format: "A4", orientation: 'portrait', margin: '1cm'},
      saveDir: path.join(__dirname, "pdfTemp"), // path for temporary files
      idLength: 30 // file ID length; adjust to avoid conflicts or just get smaller filenames
      loadTimeout: 800, // in ms; time for rendering the page
      autoCleanFileAgeInSec: 24 * 3600 // [s]; older files are removed; set to "-1" to disable remove
    };
```

If you want to just edit the settings for one render, you can do this by passing in just the object fields
you want to change as the second argument:

```javascript
    url2pdf.renderPdf("http://www.google.com", {paperSize: {orientation: "landscape"}});
```

## Notes

#### If you load a bigger webpage (images etc.), ensure, the loadTimeout is long enough to get everything!


#### Fonts/Page Too large?
There is a problem with PhantomJS related to this very long thread:
https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12685

This is the hacky workaround for the moment:

```css
    html {
        zoom: 0.55; /*workaround for phantomJS2 rendering pages too large*/
    }
```



## Tests
Just run `node example.js` which runs the available functions. If you are contributing code - at the very least run it to make sure it all seems ok

## Alternatives
In adding this to another project I discovered the community has extended the project. While I am still using this in production at the time of this edit, there hasn't been a flurry of upgrades because it just keeps working.

However you might also want to check out these projects that have built on url2pdf:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/url2pdf3

https://www.npmjs.com/package/url2pdf-plus (now deprecated in favour of url2pdf3 but apparently has some features not moved forward)
